# IT112pythonclub
Student django project for IT112 <br>

Developed a Django app to create a site integrated with a database to host a club's meetings, minutes, resources, and events. Users can create and edit information when logged in. Makes use of models, views, urls, database views, forms, tests, authentication, and more. <br>
